    h2 How To Use Kinopio

    p Kinopio is designed to
    ol
      li Get the chaotic messy thoughts and ideas out of your head
      li Show you how theyâ€™re connected
      li Help you figure out what they mean, and how to start working on them

    p "Let me show you"

    p Tap anywhere to make a new card. Put an idea, thought, or feeling in it. It doesnâ€™t need to make sense right now. Make some more, wherever you want. Drag cards to move them with a jolly wiggle.

    // figcaption Get your feelings out

    p By now some of these ideas might be connected â€“ so letâ€™s connect them by dragging from one card connector to another.

    p Connections can also be tapped on to edit their color and type, among other things.

    p Youâ€™ve got the gist!
    p Kinopio is made for people who have ideas, feelings, or thoughts theyâ€™re struggling to express, organize, and understand.
    p ..fragile ideas to plant and grow, or thorny problems to think through
    p Rather than replacing useful team/planning/productivity tools you may already be using like Notion or Trello [], Kinopio is for things that don't work super well in linear documents and tables.  [it's best for exploratory, collaborative, things]


    p But hereâ€™s one more thing. You can paint over cards to move and edit them all together. It's pretty magical, although I am biased.
